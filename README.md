# Car-Price-Prediction

# Problem Setting
Geely Auto, a Chinese automobile company, seeks to enter the US market by establishing a manufacturing plant there and producing cars locally in order to compete with their American and European counterparts. They engaged a consulting company to gain a complete understanding of current conditions. They are particularly interested in understanding the factors that affect car pricing on the American market, which may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wanted to know which variables are significant in predicting the price and how well those variables correspond to a car’s price.

# Problem definition
To recognize how prices vary with independent variables, Geely Auto has collected a large dataset of various types of cars in the American market, which can be used to identify how prices vary with independent variables. Our project aims to find the best prediction model to estimate a car's price based on a significant variable. This model can also serve as an excellent tool to identify the pricing dynamics of a new market. In addition, we want to know how the variable describes the auto's price.

# Data Source 
This project’s dataset was taken from Kaggle’s automobiles and vehicles dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction). The dataset was taken in 1987 based one 1985 model import car, truck specification and insurance collision report and was generated to learning purposes. 

# Data Description 
	The Car Price dataset consist of 205 observations with 24 variables. This dataset comprises three types of factors: 
The car’s specification that explains several characteristics of the car 
Insurance risk rating (symbolling process) is ranging from -3 to 3 which corresponds to the degree of risk associated with the car’s price. A value of 3 means that the car is risky. On the other hand, insurance risk with rating -3 means the car is safe. 
The relative average loss payment for each insured vehicle year. This record is normalized based on the size classification, for instance two-door small, station wagons, sport, etc. It also depicts the mean loss per car per year.
